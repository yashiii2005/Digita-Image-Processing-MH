# 🖼️ Image Processing Practicals using Python / Scilab

This repository contains a complete set of **Image Processing practical programs** implemented using **Python** (with OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Image) or **Scilab**.  
The experiments cover basic image manipulation, transformations, arithmetic and logical operations, histogram processing, filtering, frequency domain analysis, and morphological operations.
